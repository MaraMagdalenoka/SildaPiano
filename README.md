Along with python we used Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and FullCalendar
# Authors and their motivation
Project was made by two very young developers (Māra Magdaļenoka, Sīlinda Gercāne) as a final project during Software Development Academy (SDA) courses. Our biggest motivation for this project was to learn as much as we can and make a webpage that we would be proud of. As always there is a big space for improvement, especially in this state, but we can assure you that better days will come for SildaPiano. 
# Future for SildaPiano
We hope that soon this webpage will be used not only for reservation, but also as a payment method. Maybe even a place where you can rent musical instruments. Design improvements, more detailed information and bug fixes will see you soon.
