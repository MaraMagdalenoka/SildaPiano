# SildaPiano
Webpage for potential students who would like to learn how to play piano in a fun and interesting way. When visiting this webpage, you get all the information you might need when looking for your next music teacher. 
# Contents
- Homepage - can help people understand if this is the right thing for them
- About page - description about the teacher and her background
- Contacts page - for getting in touch
- Calendar - graphic information about available lesson times (also for lesson reservation)
- SignUp and LogIn pages - self-explanatory
- Profile page - in case you forget your name
# Usage
This webpage has two main usages:
- for getting information about lessons
- for private lesson reservation
# Used technologies
Along with python we used Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and FullCalendar
# Authors and their motivation
Project was made by two very young developers (Māra Magdaļenoka, Sīlinda Gercāne) as a final project during Software Development Academy (SDA) courses. Our biggest motivation for this project was to learn as much as we can and make a webpage that we would be proud of. As always there is a big space for improvement, especially in this state, but we can assure you that better days will come for SildaPiano. 
# Future for SildaPiano
We hope that soon this webpage will be used not only for reservation, but also as a payment method. Maybe even a place where you can rent musical instruments. Design improvements, more detailed information and bug fixes will see you soon.
